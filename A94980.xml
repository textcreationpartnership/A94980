         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the County of <hi>Devon</hi> at a Market Town called <hi>Bow,</hi> liveth one <hi>John Buxford</hi> by profeÅ¿Å¿ion a WorÅ¿ted-comber having a Son named <hi>JoÅ¿eph,</hi> aged fifteene years or thereabouts, whom he had bound Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to a Weaver, named <hi>Simon Culiver</hi> dwelling in <hi>Crediton:</hi> this <hi>JoÅ¿eph</hi> being a Å¿tubborne and untowardly Boy, could not brooke his MaÅ¿ters Å¿ervice, but after a Moneths time Å¿ecretly departed away to the Kings Army with one <hi>Byerly</hi> a Leiutenant to a Troop of HorÅ¿e in the Lord of <hi>Cleavelands</hi> Brigade, with whom he continued a roguiÅ¿h courÅ¿e of life; moÅ¿t of this laÅ¿t Summer till the defeat which the Cavaliers received at <hi>Langport-Moore,</hi> where the Leiutenant his MaÅ¿ter loÅ¿t his HorÅ¿e, and cloathes, and the Boy was Å¿tripped and turned into ragges: Å¿o that Å¿eeing no probability to be furniÅ¿hed with apparell from his MaÅ¿ter, he came home to the old man his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon the fifth day of <hi>November</hi> in the morning, he charged the Boy to prepare himÅ¿elf for to goe along with him to <hi>Crediton,</hi> which the Boy preÅ¿ently refuÅ¿ed, <hi>Å¿aying he would rather go to the Devill:</hi> whereupon the old man taking him by the arme did fall a beating of him, Å¿o that by meere force compelled him along, (the Boy all the time uÅ¿ing many bitter execrations, and the father beÅ¿towing many grievous Å¿tripes up on his Å¿houlders) contiuning this poÅ¿ture for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove balfe a miles diÅ¿tance from the Towne, which they met with a Carrier driving before him foure HorÅ¿es loaden with packes of Cloath, who Å¿eemed to this <hi>John Buxford</hi> to be one whom he had often obÅ¿erved to frequend the Roade.

The Carrier replyed, that, <hi>it was pitty the Boy Å¿hould miÅ¿carry by undertaking a forced Å¿ervice upon him: But if they two could agree, and that the Boy were willing to goe a long with him, he doubted not but he Å¿hould find a MaÅ¿ter for him, and Å¿uch employment as would put him in the way to gaine a compleat estate to maintaine himÅ¿elf and helpe his friends.</hi> But the old man willingly liÅ¿ted to the Carriers propoÅ¿ition, and being very deÅ¿irous to provide for his Å¿ons good, (as the naturall affection of all Parents towards Children doth greatly oblige) was content that he Å¿hould goe a long with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, who condtioned with him to bring or Å¿end backe the Boy in eight daies time at the furtheÅ¿t, if he Å¿hould not take likeing of the promiÅ¿ed Å¿ervice, thus all parties have concluded, the boy being more inclined to any Å¿ervice then to live with his old MaÅ¿ter the Weaver.
